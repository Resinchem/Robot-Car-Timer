### 3D Printed Parts
A few optional 3D printed enclosure design files are provided here.  Note that use of 3D printed parts is _entirely optional_ and is not required for system functionality.  You can substitue project boxes or omit enclosures altogether.

All enclosures were printed with PLA.  **Supports are highly recommended for all parts**.

#### Controller Enclosure

A simple enclosure for the ESP32 controller.  Designed for a standard 1/2 size ElectroCookie solderable breadboard with height to accommodate pin headers.  Mounting posts that accept M2 screws elevates the ElectroCookie board so that wiring may be completed on the top or bottom of the board.

#### MAX7219 Timer Enclosure
![TimerEnclosure_small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/332b6f64-571a-43d3-946f-d92583a03675)

The timer enclosure not only houses the MAX7219 dot-matrix display, but also the push buttons and toggle switch for the system.  The MAX7219 should pressure fit, but if it is loose or tends to fall out, just a couple of spots of hot glue on the vertical back supports will keep the display in place but still allow it to be removed if necessary.

#### VL53L0X Mount
![VL53L0X_Mount_small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d17a905-21a0-4dbf-85ac-befa96ef5640)

This mount provides a mounting bracket that allows the VL53L0X to be mounted while still allowing vertical and horizontal adjustments so that sensor can be precisely aligned with the start/finish lines.  It is a slightly remixed version of the [original version by Speedfreek01 via Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4511170).

_These files are provided "as-is" and unfortunately I cannot modify or print parts for individual use._
